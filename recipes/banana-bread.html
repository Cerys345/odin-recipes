        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A tasty and easy to make banana loaf recipe drizzled with icing.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>140g butter</li>
            <li>140g caster sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>140g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>2 very ripe bananas</li>
            <li>50g icing sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter a 2lb loaf tin and line the base and sides with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Cream 140g softened butter and 140g caster sugar until light and fluffy, then slowly add 2 beaten large eggs with a little of the 140g flour.</li>
            <li>Fold in the remaining flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 2 mashed bananas.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for about 50 mins, or until cooked through. Check the loaf at 5-min intervals from around 30-40 mins in the oven by testing it with a skewer (it should be able to be inserted and removed cleanly), as the time may vary depending on the shape of your loaf tin.</li>
            <li>Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove to a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Mix 50g icing sugar with 2-3 tsp water to make a runny icing.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the icing across the top of the cake and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
